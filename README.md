<p align="center">Child Processes are included, you will only see these in Microsoft Store apps. These processes have to be hijacked by Injecting to the Child Processes as Injecting on the Parent Process will not work or crash the process. <b>These processes are usually marked by "AppxWindow"</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>There is a Process Filter, System Processes or games that will ban for Memory Injecting, not EVERY game is included.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>It's open source, you can build your own version without those restrictions. ProcessListManager Class manages these app restrictions.</b></p>

<p align="center"><b>Any Issues you have can be submitted in the "Issues" tab above. If you have any ideas, you can submit a "Feature Request".</b></p>
